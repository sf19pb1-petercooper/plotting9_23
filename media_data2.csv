Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a key component to open banking, in which banks open up their systems and allow third parties to access their data to enhance their own services. This growing market is transforming retail banking, reshaping incumbents' relationships with customers, and easing entry for fintechs. The UK is leading the open banking movement with regulatory efforts that are reverberating throughout the world. Countries across continents have introduced open banking regulations of their own, indicating that the financial services industry is moving toward an era where sharing data and infrastructure will be table stakes. <br> <br>Here are the top companies already implementing BaaS strategies, broken out into two main categories: <br> <br>Pure BaaS Providers Retail Banks w/ BaaS Services Pure BaaS Providers solarisBank Founded in 2016, solarisBank's lets customers seamlessly integrate financial services into their offerings through modern RESTful APIs.

In fact, Accenture projects open banking-related services will account for 7% of total banking revenue by 2020 â€” less than two years after the UK's open banking regulation rollout. <br> <br>For now, these regulations don't require banks to begin offering BaaS, so those that choose to do so will be ahead of the curve â€” and likely see high demand as a result. <br> <br>To keep you ahead of the industry's biggest shifts â€“ like the open banking movement and BaaS â€“ is launching Banking in September, a new research area with coverage including BaaS and open banking, consumer and business banking, mobile and online banking, digital account opening, and neobanks.",The top companies providing & using banking-as-a-service technology (BBVA),Business Insider
